Hello, my name is Sahatsawat Boonchit, but you can call me Euro. I graduated from Rajamangala University of Technology Phra Nakhon. I am interested in working as a Front-End or Back-End Developer. I have 6 months of internship experience working as a Front-End Developer. I was assigned to develop the HIS (Hospital Information Systems) for a hospital. Currently I am studying to enhance my skills in developing Microservice systems.
